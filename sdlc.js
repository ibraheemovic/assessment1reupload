// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const Analysisofrequirements = "requirement analysis focuses on the tasks that determine the needs or conditions to meet the new or altered product or project."
const design = " the purpose of the design phase is to transform the requirements into complete and detailed system design specifications."
const Implementation = "implementation includes user notification, user training, installation of hardware, installation of software onto production computers, and integration of the system into daily work processes."
const Testing = "testing phase of the software development lifecycle is where you focus on investigation and discovery"
const Maintain = "where the software is monitored to ensure it continues to function as it was designed to, and repairs or upgrades are performed as needed."
